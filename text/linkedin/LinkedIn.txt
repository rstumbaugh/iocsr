To upgrade my LinkedIn profile, I have been adding many more connections over the past few weeks. I am now getting close to 200 connections, which is definitely a personal milestone. My profile was fairly complete beforehand, but there were still some changes I made. I have recently decided that I would like to eventually go into Business or Data Analytics, which I have listed on my profile and in my tagline. I also included a link to my Github profile, which is sort of a portfolio of projects that many developers use. My Github profile contains my big projects and websites (including this one!) and has the source code available for other developers to see.
