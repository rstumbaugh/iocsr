This is my third reflection I’ve written for Dr. Wellman, the first being in BMGT289 and the second for the West Coast Study Tour this past summer. Though the writing is at times tedious and, needless to say, time consuming, I feel like I do benefit from these reflections. Looking back and forcing myself to think about what I really took away from a class session, speaker, or event is a great way to realize just how much I have grown during this class. <br>
<br>
I feel I have not only become a more effective speaker but also a more efficient person as a result of this class. The lessons on resilience, change, and motivation provide a great way to step back and think critically about what I’m doing and how I can change my ways to be more effective. Doing the TED Talk was also a fantastic way to increase my public speaking ability and get a chance to practice what we had been talking about in class. The most interesting part of this class, especially Ira’s sessions, was how we could actually see Ira practicing what he was teaching while he was teaching it to us. After all, a class session isn’t totally different from a presentation, and the principles behind audience engagement, gestures, and other presenting concepts are still the same. <br>
<br>
In addition, I am also more observant of others’ presentations and what they do right and wrong. When you see a good presentation, you can tell that it’s good. It might be difficult, however, to pinpoint exactly what a person did that made you think they had a good presentation. As a result of this class, I am not only more observant but also able to tell what makes a person’s presentation great. Perhaps this is a result of giving my own presentation with this knowledge in mind and realizing first hand just how difficult it is to effectively implement some of the techniques we have discussed. For example, Dan Parsons’ presentation was interesting albeit long. He did a good job of keeping the audience engaged with his voice and mannerisms, as well as clearly being a master of pitch, cadence, tone, and other aspects of presenting. After doing in-class activities that involved thinking on the spot and incorporating some aspects of delivery, it was really easy to see just how difficult it really is to effectively utilize some of these skills, and I have certainly grown a new appreciation for those who have mastered these skills.<br>
<br>
Writing this reflection, I have noticed I have also grown a bit in skills unrelated to delivering a presentation. Time management was certainly a huge concern with a large paper like this, and having to manage time effectively is a skill I have had to work on ever since I started college. With so many distractions left and right, it can be difficult to maintain focus over a long period of time. Throughout the process of this reflection, I have definitely improved my time management skills.<br>
<br>
The final skill I feel I have improved over the course of this class is stress management. This sort of goes hand in hand with time management, but I still feel it deserves to be mentioned. By following a few of the skills listed in the Dale Carnegie book, I feel as though I am better at multitasking and coping with the huge amount of stressed I’ve been faced with this semester. <br>
<br>
I have grown in many ways throughout this semester and as a result of writing this reflection and consider the class an overall positive experience in terms of personal and professional growth.<br>
