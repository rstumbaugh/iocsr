<h2>Better Tomorrow Message</h2><br>
<strong>Promoting the pursuit of knowledge.</strong><br>
The Better Tomorrow Message was one of our first assignments for the class. At first, the idea of a Better Tomorrow message was a bit confusing, as I was thinking more along the lines of what do <i>I</i> want to do. Eventually, it clicked that the Better Tomorrow message wasn’t about what I want to do but rather to tell others how I can make <i>their</i> tomorrow better. This assignment helped set the tone for the class in terms of gearing your presentation for an audience and having a clear cut message.<br>

<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2><br>
This was my first experience writing an elevator pitch about myself, and at first it was a bit awkward. My first couple of iterations lacked a direct message and felt more like myself listing off my accomplishments. Eventually, I fine-tuned it to be a story that I feel encapsulates my drive, determination, and skill as a software developer. Though I will probably not end up reciting my pitch word-for-word, it definitely serves as a good guideline when I do want to present myself in a quick way at a career fair or networking event. Writing my elevator pitch help me develop a clear message and effectively convey that message in a presentation, which is a skill I feel has carried over to my other presentations.<br>

<h2>Personal Story</h2><br>
My personal story was about programming some changes into my favorite computer game in 9th grade. While not a very life-changing event, this was definitely an event that sparked my passion for computer science and opened my eyes to what I could accomplish with programming. The story itself demonstrates my eagerness and drive as well as my resourcefulness, and I feel it is a good complement to my overall Better Tomorrow message. Writing this story for the assignment was a great lesson in terms of storytelling and controlling the flow of my stories. It really showed me the amount of deliberation that went into telling a story and how literary devices need to be purposefully included rather than just appearing in a story.<br>

<h2>TED Talk Storyboard</h2><br>
Storyboarding my TED Talk before actually writing it helped <strong>immensely</strong> in terms of organization and having a clear direction. After writing a storyboard, it was a lot easier to get started on the presentation now that I had an idea of how I wanted it to be structured. Storyboarding is a technique I had never used before in a presentation, and I feel it can be applied to other assignments as well, especially essays or long papers.<br>
<br>
<h2>TED Talk</h2><br>
The TED Talk, clearly, was the biggest assignment of the semester (next to the IOCSR). This presentation really helped me focus on my presentation skills and think critically about what makes a good presentation. It was a great opportunity to apply what we have learned in the class practically and step outside of our comfort zones. Looking back, I would say I learned more about giving a presentation when reflecting on my TED Talk rather than preparing for it. Like many other skills in life, you can only get better at public speaking by doing it rather than studying it. Looking back and reflecting on what I did right and what I did wrong during my presentation is a fantastic way to get better and improve my presentation skills. As awkward as it is to watch myself speak, it really is the best resource I have available. <br>
<br>
I’m glad we got to do a presentation with the freedom of the TED Talk because it added another challenge: ensuring your topic was relevant and interesting. The TED Talk was a great experience in terms of personal and professional growth.<br>
