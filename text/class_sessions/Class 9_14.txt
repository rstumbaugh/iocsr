<h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class, we discussed the Dale Carnegie program and some of the key principles behind the program. We reviewed our personal skillset and talked about the Fundamental Techniques in Handling People:<br>

<ul><br>
<li>Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.</li>
<li>Give honest and sincere appreciation</li>
<li>Arouse in the other person an eager want.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We also discussed the notion of “success” and what predicts success, what is success, and the perception of success in other cultures. We ended the class talking about what it takes to be a leader and the five qualities of a leader: <strong>self awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.</strong> Unsurprisingly, all of these qualities are geared more towards social intelligence rather than traditional “textbook” intelligence. As we left, we closed the class on the notion of the importance of honest and direct feedback and the importance of asking “how am I doing?” to others.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
In every class, it is interesting to learn something so applicable and directly relevant to my present and future. It was intriguing to hear about how GPA was not a great predictor of success, and that emotional intelligence is a far better predictor of whether or not an individual will be successful. The Dale Carnegie Fundamental Techniques were also very interesting to learn about; it is intriguing to see someone break down leadership and emotional intelligence into its fundamental components and teach it almost as a science. <br>
<br>
I can personally identify with the final technique: arousing an eager want. All throughout my educational career, I’ve noticed that the classes I enjoy the most are the ones in which the teacher presents the information in an interesting and engaging manner. In other words, I tend to enjoy a class more when the teacher makes me want to learn more. Having worked with kids for over 5 years as a tennis instructor, I can also attest to the fact that kids are much more willing to participate and have a good time when they want to have fun. It is all about framing the activity and how it is presented.<br>
<br>
Finally, we touched on the importance of honest and direct feedback. This can often be difficult to get, especially from the people you are most likely to ask for feedback from (close friends, family, etc). Obviously, my mother is going to give much more positive feedback that is not necessarily direct than some random stranger or acquaintance. It is important not only to get this feedback but also to take it to heart and really internalize what the other person has said.<br>
