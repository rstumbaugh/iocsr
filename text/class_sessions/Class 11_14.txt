<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The main focus in this class was preparing us for the Everest assessment and watching the preparatory videos. In addition, Dr. Wellman gave us some tips as to what we should focus on while completing the Everest assessment: in particular, the concept of unique vs. shared information. <br>
<br>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Though a relatively slow class, there were definitely still lessons to be learned. The idea of unique and shared information was certainly something to keep in mind going into the Everest simulation. Unfortunately, my group didnâ€™t do a great job with managing unique information, and our first attempts did not go great (I will go into more detail in the section on the Everest assessment). This is not just a concept that can be applied to this particular simulation, however. In life, especially in group settings, it is important that all other groups are aware of all pertinent information. It was especially interesting to hear from Dr. Wellman that the 9/11 attacks actually could have been prevented if the various government agencies had communicated their unique information with each other. Having a lot of data and information is one thing, but being able to make sure that other groups and agencies have access to it is arguably more important that having the actual information. This class was important in terms of opening my eyes to the importance of communication outside of a formal presentation setting.<br>
