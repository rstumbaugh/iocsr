<h2>Summary</h2><br>
This class session focused on the ins and outs of teamwork. Too often do people resort to teams or groups to solve a problem simply for the sake of having a team without really thinking about whether or not a team is really the right solution for a problem. We discussed some myths about teamwork, such as that teams are always the answer, most people enjoy teamwork, and that all teammates must like each other for a team to be successful. <br>
<br>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Throughout my educational experience, Iâ€™ve been a part of many group projects with many different types of people. I can confidently say that being a part of a team is <i>not</i> always the answer. Many times, an individual can get more work done and can make better decisions than when being a part of a team. However, at times I felt like these feelings may have been just a result of an aversion or dislike for teamwork. It was definitely interesting to hear that my feelings about teamwork are not necessarily unique and that others feel this way as well.<br>
<br>
Working as a part of a team is certainly essential in business, but not necessarily applicable in every situation. Teamwork is <strong>not</strong> always the answer, but it can often help problem solving and providing a diverse set of perspectives when approaching a difficult problem.<br>
