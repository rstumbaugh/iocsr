<h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class session, we talked more about some of the fundamentals of communication and some of Ira’s core beliefs. We were introduced to the concept of “yes, and…” and participated in an activity involving building on what our partners were saying rather than ignoring them or totally changing topic. Ira shared with us his 3 Big Ideas regarding presentations: <br>

<ol><br>
<li>Promise a Better Tomorrow</li>
<li>Design great slides</li>
<li>Deliver “tell me more”</li>
</ol>
We also discussed the concept of a Better Tomorrow Message, the short 1 or 2 line phrase that should encompass who we are, what we plan to do, and why someone else should care. In other words, how we plan to create a better tomorrow. We worked on our own Better Tomorrow Messages and also received feedback on our Elevator Pitches.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
In the previous class, we learned that communication was a skill that could be improved. In this class, I learned just how much improvement I really needed! Doing the “Yes, and…” practice really opened my eyes to how difficult it was to go along with what someone was saying when it was almost completely irrelevant to what I wanted to talk about. Watching Ira so effortlessly pivot the conversation and subtly change subjects really put my communications skills into perspective. In addition, it was very interesting to hear Ira talk about the importance of minimalistic slides that take no more than 3 seconds to process and discuss key aspects of an effective presentation while witnessing these principles firsthand. Ira certainly practices what he preaches, and it was very cool to see the skills immediately applied. <br>
<br>
Finally, I was intrigued to hear that most newspapers, presenters, and publications write on a 6th-8th grade level. Any more complex than that, and it can get difficult to maintain the audience’s attention. It was during this class that I realized just how applicable and interesting this course would be.<br>
