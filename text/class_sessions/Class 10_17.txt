<h2>Summary</h2><br>
This class session was mostly spent sharing our fully-fleshed personal stories with a small group as well as being introduced to our TED Talk assignment. The story sharing involved getting a group of 2-3 and reading our story to others in the group, focusing on delivery and literary devices to make the reader feel more engaged.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Although we didn’t do much outside of sharing our stories in this class session, I can certainly say I learned many things. Every time we do an assignment that involves presenting, whether it be our elevator pitch or a personal story like this, I am reminded of the importance of practice and deliberate inclusion of literary devices in my presentations. With practice, presenting becomes easier and more natural. I definitely needed more practice with my story at this point in the course. When I don’t know my material well, it feels like I am focusing too much on the content rather than the delivery. While the importance of a presentation’s content should not be discredited, it is the delivery which really determines how engaged the listener will be. I have since been more mindful of remembering my content and focusing on the delivery as much as the presentation.<br>
