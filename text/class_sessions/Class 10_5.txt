<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The main purpose of this class was to discuss the art of storytelling. We discussed not only the importance of a well-crafted story but also its effects in business and office culture. Office culture, Ira says, is a combination of the stories you tell, the stories your employees tell, and the stories your customers tell. Humans respond best to emotionally charged stories rather than facts and figures, so it is clear as to why stories are so important.<br>
<br>
More important than having a good story is having the ability to convey your story in an effective and universal manner. The purpose of a story should be to <i>convey a message</i> rather than simply tell someone something that happened to you; the story is simply a vehicle. Ira created an acronym for the key elements of storytelling: STORY.

<li><strong>T</strong> - Tick tock</li>
<li><strong>O</strong> - One BIG idea</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> - Resonate</li>
<li><strong>Y</strong> - Yin Yang</li>
</ul>
<br>
We dove into each of these aspects of storytelling and sat and wrote our own stories that have shaped our life in some way. Our homework was to refine one of these stories and fill out the story framework. <br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Like most other subjects we covered in this class, I figured that storytelling was just something that some people were good at and others were not. Maybe this is because those who are really good at it make it seem effortless. Either way, during this class I realized that being a good storyteller is, above all else, <i>deliberate</i>. It takes effort to incorporate literary devices, sensory appeals, and gripping details into a story. In addition, it is more difficult than it sounds to figure out the message that you’re trying to deliver through your story. It is important to remember that the story, especially in a presentation, is simply a vehicle for a larger message that should be your Better Tomorrow message.<br>
<br>
It was also during this class that I started to see how it was all connected: the story, the presentation, the TED Talk, the Better Tomorrow message, all of it. Basically, the main idea that I took away from this class is that your entire presentation and all of its components should be focused on one clear universal message. Looking back, I wish I had incorporated a bit more of this connectedness into my TED Talk.<br>
