<h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class session, we discussed some more aspects of what makes a story or presentation gripping, and how we can incorporate some of these elements into our own presentations. Specifically, we talked about time control, inner dialogue, and “bring backs”. Time control is when a speaker skips forward or backward in time to cut out unimportant details (“fast-forward 10 years”, etc). A “bring back” is when the speaker references some theme or part of the story or presentation that was mentioned earlier to re-emphasize the device. This does not necessarily have to be repetition; the main idea is to reinforce the point the speaker was trying to make.<br>

In addition, we talked about “symbol stories” of a company. Symbol stories are when a company uses a seemingly meaningless object or symbol as a key part of their culture because of the story behind it. We watched a couple of videos where companies used a clock and a water pressure valve as representations of the company’s values. <br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
From this class session, I mainly took away some new techniques to incorporate into my presentations and stories. The more I think back on effective presentations (and the more I watch new presentations), I definitely notice the use of bring backs and inner dialogue as effective tools. Time control is important, but I feel that I often overlook it as just a minor detail in the overall story. Inner dialogue, however, really sets the scene for the story and helps the reader feel both more engaged and immersed in the story. Bring backs, in addition, are great for really driving main points home with the listener. It is much more powerful and helps the audience feel a sense of connectedness in a presentation when they are literally presented with a statement that connects the closing to the opening.<br>

In regards to the concept of “symbol stories”, I feel they are an effective tool for emphasizing company values and goals. This type of inside reference between employees and management make it much more powerful when the employee first learns the story behind the seemingly meaningless object or symbol. I thought these were an interesting concept and have been keeping my eye out for any symbol stories — the first one that popped into my mind was the infamous waffle iron at Nike, which I got a chance to see firsthand over the summer.  <br>
