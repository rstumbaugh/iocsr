<h2>Summary</h2><br>
This class session focused on the topic of change, something that we have all undoubtedly had experience with. The class started off with a list of “myths vs. realities” about change (admittedly, I had believed many of the myths were true, such as “crisis is a powerful impetus for change”). In fact, one shocking statistic we covered was that <strong>90%</strong> of bypass patients don’t sustain their lifestyle changes after the procedure. Clearly, it takes a lot more than some huge dramatic event to get people to actually change. We discussed the idea of resistance to change and the different types of resistance. <br>

One of my favorite parts of the course actually took place in this class: the video for “Who moved my cheese?” While presented in a somewhat silly manner, with cartoon mice and men running around some huge labyrinth looking for huge supplies of cheese, the ideas presented and the different personality types represented by the characters of the cartoon were more intricate than they would appear. I certainly learned a lot through this class and this video, and was thinking the entire time, “Which one of these characters do I identify with the most?”<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
This class session was especially relevant to me, as I had been thinking a lot about making some major changes to my habits and lifestyle. I feel I learned a lot about myself, specifically in terms of how people react to change and examining how I myself was currently reacting to change. The preparation reading for this class in particular was relevant and interesting, as it touched on the plasticity of the brain and potential catalysts for change, as well as how change can be framed so that a person would be more likely to change. <br>
<br>
In terms of the reading, <i>Change or Die</i>, I particularly liked the section on the stages of change. When examining how I approached change, particularly in terms of exercising and getting to the gym, I noticed that I spent a lot of time in the “ready for change any day now, but not just yet” phase, which most people typically do not leave. Over the summer, I was very diligent with getting to the gym 3 times weekly, but as soon as I got back to school, I quickly fell off my schedule. I learned firsthand just how easy it is to revert back to old ways after change, and this was another big point brought up by the reading. <br>
<br>
I really did like the “Who moved my cheese?” video, and feel I can identify with Haw the most. If the “cheese” is what I want in life, and the “maze” is the obstacles that might be in the way, I feel I am relatively adaptable, although I might be set back for a bit after any type of big sweeping change. This class session was certainly one of the more relevant sessions, at least in terms of my personal experiences and what I was and am currently dealing with, and I feel I got a good deal out of it.<br>
