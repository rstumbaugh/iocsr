<h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class session, we were introduced to some of the topics that we would be covering in the course and started our discussion on what it takes to be great. Communication is a crucial skill to have, and many believe it is some innate trait. However, we learned that the skills of negotiating, communicating, and presenting are all qualities that can be practiced and improved. We discussed the 10,000 hours principle and talked about Geoff Colvin’s beliefs on talent — “talent is overrated.” In addition, we covered Google’s Eight Good Behaviors for being an effective manager, which include empowering your team and being a good communicator. The main idea of this class was to introduce us to what we would be covering further on in the course and clear up any misconceptions that these skills were inherent and could not be changed.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Going into this course, I was already dreading a class on communications and public speaking. While I would not consider myself a poor communicator, it is definitely not one of my strong suits, and public speaking was the bane of my existence. I also was of the belief that these were skills that couldn’t be improved, and that I would just have to deal with being an <i>okay</i> communicator forever. However, after this class, my views had certainly changed. It was great to hear that this was an area I could improve upon, and I was eager to learn more about how to build my skillset.<br>

In addition, it was interesting to hear about Google’s rules to be a great boss. I was intrigued to notice that only one of the eight behaviors had to do with any actual technical skills, and the spirit of the behavior was not to be a technical expert but rather to be skilled enough to advise the team. This class session was definitely eye-opening in terms of the importance of communication.<br>
