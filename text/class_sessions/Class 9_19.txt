<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The main focus of this class was TED/TEDx Talks and what makes them successful. We watched a variety of TEDx Talks, and more importantly discussed the most salient aspects of each talk. Interestingly enough, among the top 20 talks, the average reading level was around 7th grade. This reinforces a concept that we covered earlier in the class about sophistication vs simplicity and which one people are more likely to pay attention to or internalize. <br>

In addition, Ira discussed his 8 Keys to an effective presentation:<br>

With each of these steps, we watched a TEDx Talk that related to what Ira was telling us. It was interesting to see the concepts discussed by these professional speakers and great minds. In addition, we discussed the importance of words and slides and, again, got to see these concepts put into action.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
The main takeaway I got from this class was that being a great presenter certainly doesn’t come naturally. Of course, we had already learned that communication is a skill that can be improved, not a natural talent, etc. However, watching how effortlessly these TED presenters gave incredibly effective and memorable presentations really drove in the point that being a great presenter is a deliberate action. While some may have a bit more “natural talent” than others, that certainly doesn’t mean they will ultimately end up giving a better presentation. The process of creating slides, thinking about your Better Tomorrow, call-to-action, visuals, stories, memorable moments, and more is an incredibly deliberate process and will likely not come natural to anyone. Yet, during the presentation, it all looks so effortless. I guess that’s how you can tell that someone really put in their work: when it doesn’t look like they’re trying.<br>
<br>
Lastly, it was very interesting to hear Ira’s points about knowing your audience. I particularly liked the slide that said, “Designing a presentation without an audience in mind is like writing a love letter and addressing it, ‘To Whom It May Concern:’.” In order to engage the audience, it is imperative that the presenter has them in mind while writing his stories and slides.<br>
