<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The focus of this class session was reflecting on the Business, Society, and the Economy program of College Park Scholars, specifically creating a mission / values statement for the program and what we feel are the goals of the program, both short and long term. We drafted a mission statement, a vision statement, a list of values, short-term learning objectives, and long-term career objectives. In other words, what do students hope to gain from this program? What separates students who were in BSE from their peers? <br>

After drafting up a summary of the program’s missions, values, and goals, we were introduced to the Everest Simulation and the goal of the simulation / any potential challenges. We discussed the importance of synergy and the mentality of groups that climb Mount Everest in real life as well as one of the biggest concerns: shared information vs. unique information. <br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
As we are nearing the end of our time in BSE, I have been thinking about what I have gotten out of the program and whether or not I made the right choice with my scholars program. As a computer science major, many are often confused as to why I would pick a business-oriented program. Looking back, I can confidently say that I made the right choice in joining the BSE program. The connections I have made, both personal and professional, as well as the concepts and skills I have learned are invaluable. In this class, I noticed that it was very easy to recognize that BSE centers around community, innovation, creativity, and a few other core values. This class session was a great chance to look back and really think about what the program has succeeded in doing for us in terms of short and long term goals. In addition, I have met some of my closest friends in the BSE program, and I feel a strong sense of community even with those I might not be as close with. I really enjoyed this class session as a way to think critically about what I have really gotten out of BSE, both personally and professionally.<br>

In addition, I felt that the reading on Abilene’s Paradox was both interesting and beneficial. Though unaware of the official name of the paradox prior to the reading, I can recall many times that I’ve experienced this situation, and it wasn’t until afterwards that we all realized that nobody was actually in favor of the decision that we made as a group, but everyone just went along with it because they assumed it would be best for the group. It was interesting to follow the 5 components of the paradox, as well as read about how it may affect the fast world of global business, where quick decisions must be made often. The main takeaway I got from this reading was that before making group decisions, clear and direct communication is key to ensure that we are truly heading in the right direction.<br>
