<h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class session, we spent more time analyzing what it takes to be successful and the difference between the perceptions of what it takes to be successful versus what it actually takes. We discussed the difference  between fluid and emotional intelligence, IQ versus EQ, and practical intelligence and proactivity. The importance of deliberate practice was also covered. Practicing a skill for 10,000 hours will not necessarily make you an expert; however, <i>deliberately</i> practicing a skill, knowing what your weaknesses are and improving upon them, and being <strong>goal-oriented</strong> are really the keys to effective practicing. <br>
<br>
We also learned that being adaptable and having high emotional intelligence are much better predictors of success than GPA and “classical intelligence”. The main idea behind emotional intelligence is being able to manage not only your own emotions and self-regulate but also to be able to read and infer what others are feeling. We watched an entertaining yet informative video on Bob Knight, a fantastic basketball coach who was not great at self-regulation, which eventually led to his downfall. Lastly, we covered Dale Carnegie’s principles and his thoughts on winning people to your way of thinking and being a leader. We ended the class with a few comments on motivation, to be continued next week.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
This class struck a familiar chord with me, specifically when discussing deliberate practice. All throughout middle and high school, I played tennis year-round at least 2 days/week. I definitely noticed long periods of time that I didn’t get much better, even with all of this practicing. Looking back, it felt like I was just going through the motions and not really thinking about or internalizing the reasons I wasn’t improving or any specific techniques I should work on. It was definitely interesting to hear about deliberate practice and the theories behind it.<br>
<br>
In our society, there is such a high value placed on intelligence and good grades. You need to do well on tests so you can have a high GPA so you can get into a good college so you can get a good job and be successful, right? Wrong. Communication skills and a high EQ are <i>much</i> more importance in terms of success. This concept of fixed intelligence leads to taking fewer risks, not giving as much effort, and underestimating the value of actually learning rather than studying for tests. Having a fluid intelligence and believing that failure can be fixed by trying harder is much more conducive to success in a professional setting. Success is about mastering your environment, and high emotional intelligence is necessary to truly evaluate your setting and determine which areas need improvement, being self-aware, and engaging others.<br>
