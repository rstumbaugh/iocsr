<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The main focus of this class was <strong>motivation</strong>. We discussed the complexity of individual motivation, both internal and external, as well as how it differs from group motivation. We talked about Dan Pink and his models of motivation (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0), as well as the concepts of incentives and expectations in terms of motivation. In addition to Dan Pink, we discussed motivation in Mary Kay, specifically why are these women so motivated, and Pete Carroll, legendary UNC coach who used his “win forever” mindset to motivate his players (and even recruit from gangs and rough neighborhoods). <br>

Another interesting topic we covered was Michael Lewis, author of The Big Short, who discussed how misused incentives led to the 2008 housing market crash. Brokers and IRS agents were incentivized not based on the quality of their mortgages and audits but rather the number. Therefore, it made much more sense for them to give out risky mortgages to those who couldn’t afford it and audit poor people who could not afford legal representation. Lastly, we discussed another huge topic in business and communications: resilience. We closed out the class with a video on James Blake, a tennis player who greeted a nearly-fatal injury with a positive attitude and resilience.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
It was certainly very interesting to delve into what intrinsically motivates people and groups as a whole. Motivation is definitely a complex topic, and what motivates one person may not motivate another. I’ve noticed that incentives don’t always motivate enough. Whether it be a couple extra dollars on top of a paycheck or a few points of extra credit, it will never be enough for some people. It was cool to watch a video on Pike Place Fish Market, which I actually got to see over this past summer on a trip with Dr. Wellman. Though I didn’t really know what was going on at the time with the fish throwing and chants, it was definitely interesting to hear about the 4 Fish Principles and the culture of such a small business. Hearing about the Fish Philosophy, I was already thinking of ways I could apply these rules to my own life, specifically “Choose your attitude.” Attitude is everything, and my attitude while approaching an event or assignment usually dictates how much I will end up enjoying something. A positive attitude goes a long way.<br>
<br>
The story of Pete Carroll was especially intriguing. Carroll’s mentality as a coach was to motivate his athletes with a positive mindset and his “Win Forever” philosophy. I was interested to hear how he initially failed as an NFL coach because his style of motivation was more geared towards college athletes and didn’t work as well with grown men. Carroll is such a selfless and positive man, and certainly a role model in terms of attitude and motivation.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I enjoyed our discussion of resilience and James Blake. From breaking his back to a severe viral infection to his dad’s death, Blake never faltered and always kept his head up (“we can laugh or cry, so I chose to laugh”). Resilience is the only skill I scored well on in the REFLECT assessment, and it is definitely a skill I value and pride myself on. The reading, “How Resilience Works”, presented a wide range of examples of resilience in the corporate world as well, and it is clear how important resilience is in a professional environment.<br>
