 <h2>Summary</h2><br>
In this class session, we discussed the ideas of Tipping Point Leadership, body language, and charisma. We examined the cases of Amy Cuddy and her powerful TED Talk on the importance of body language in terms of confidence as well as Bill Bratton, a “super-cop” who led the LAPD, NYPD and Boston Police Department and employed the skills of Tipping Point leadership to keep up his success. Bill Bratton also tried to persuade with charisma and utilize his charismatic personality to win others over to his way of thinking, which connected back to the Charismatic Leadership Tactics (CLTs) that we had talked about earlier in the class and reading. We ended our discussion talking about resilience and James Blake once again.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
I had always known the importance of charisma, but had always assumed it was some inherent trait that some had and others didn’t (which seems to be a common theme in this class!). It was very interesting to see the aspects of charisma broken down into well-defined tactics and concepts, some of which I have since tried to incorporate into my own personality, specifically stories and anecdotes as well as conveying that goals can be achieved. <br>
<br>
In addition, I felt a really strong connection with the section of the Amy Cuddy video we watched, specifically on the topic of “fake it til you make it” vs “fake it until you become it”. In middle school, my self confidence and overall self-esteem was at an all-time low. One day, I decided that I wasn’t going to let my bad thoughts control my life, and that the only way to get over this was to fake having confidence. After a while of acting a bit more confident, I realized that I had actually gained a lot of confidence and self-respect simply by acting like I had it. The Amy Cuddy video was incredibly powerful and struck a chord with me. <br>
<br>
It was also interesting to examine Bill Bratton’s success and apply the Tipping Point Leadership framework to him. Although he didn’t do as well with the political hurdles when he got squeezed out by some of the older police officers, Bratton handled the cognitive, resource, and motivational hurdles fantastically. He really knew how to frame the problems in the department and in the city to his cops and really motivate them to <i>want</i> to change rather than change because they had to. Bratton’s ways led to a decrease in crime rate and an increase in accountability within the departments. <br>
<br>
I also felt like I could really learn from the reading, “Learning Charisma”. This was all about training yourself to be more charismatic (because it is a skill that can be learned!). The main idea of the reading was similar to the ideas we covered in class — charisma is all about being present and being passionate. <br>
<br>
The videos we watched in this class session were not only inspirational but also incredibly personal, and I really enjoyed the topics we discussed and took away some great lessons and concepts to apply to my own life.<br>
