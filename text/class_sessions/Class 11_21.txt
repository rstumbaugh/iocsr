<h2>Summary</h2><br>
This class session, we reviewed different parts of people’s TED Talks and talked about what we thought worked / didn’t work. The reviews were separated by part of the presentation (intro, main points, conclusion), and we watched many short snippets of various presentations. We spent the whole class talking about the positives and negatives of each snippet of a talk we watched, and it was interesting to hear some of the different praise / criticism for each part. <br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Although my video was not included in the montage of clips, I certainly learned a lot during this class session. One particular criticism that popped up in a couple of TED Talks was focusing too much on content rather than delivery, a topic that I touched on earlier in this reflection. Again, while content is important, it’s the delivery and charisma that really sells a presentation to the audience. During my talk, I feel like I was spending too much time on remembering the words rather than focusing on my delivery and movements, which was ultimately detrimental to my presentation. <br>
<br>
On a similar note, we talked about memorization vs. expanding on main points. I had memorized my presentation verbatim, which I think was a poor decision. I would much rather have memorized my main points and the order in which I wanted to present them and just talk about them rather than completely memorize a 5 minute presentation. With memorization, it’s more difficult to adjust for time, etc. Expanding on points is not only more conducive to a flexible presentation but it also makes the presentation feel more free and natural rather than stiff and rehearsed. In my opinion, when a presentation is well-rehearsed, it shouldn’t look like it was rehearsed at all. In other words, it should appear very natural.<br>

In addition, we talked about the importance of making it apparent to the audience why your topic is relevant. Some presentations we discussed waited until the end to tell the audience why they should care. In order to really make the audience care from the very beginning, it’s important to establish the relevance in the introduction, which I did in my own TED Talk. Even if you literally have to say to the audience, “You should care because…”, it’s important to make it crystal clear why they should care.<br>
