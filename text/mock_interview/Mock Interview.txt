<h3>Tell me about yourself.</h3>
I’m a driven and self-motivated Computer Science major and web developer at the University of Maryland. Since freshman year, I’ve been learning programming in school, but the majority of my projects and learning experiences have been outside of the classroom. I’m passionate about computer science and excited to see where the career will take me along with what more I can learn.<br/><br/>


<h3>That’s interesting. Tell me more.</h3>
Over the past few years, I’ve programmed multiple projects mainly to learn new programming concepts and get some real-world coding experience outside of the classroom. My projects include a 3D solar system simulator, a castle defense game, and multiple responsive websites. The project I’m most proud of, however, is a Battleship game that I wrote when I didn’t have much experience with programming at all. I learned more creating this project than I had learned in any course at the time of its creation. The game features the ability to either play against a computer or play against a friend on a different computer.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about a creative approach you took to solve a problem. How did you come up with this approach? Did you consider other options?</h3>
At my new job as a web developer for the university, I am often faced with problems that involve making an application easier to use and follow along as a user. For example, my most recent project involves redesigning an application website to make it more user-friendly. The design I had come up with with involved a sidebar to keep track of the step of the application the user was on. This design looked great on a desktop, but not so great on mobile. I had thought for awhile on how to make it both visually appealing, minimal, and clear to the user as to how to use the feature. I offered 3 different ideas to my manager: a smaller version of the sidebar at the top of the page, a full sidebar that can be hidden / revealed, or a drop-down list. I let my manager decide which one he felt was the most user-friendly and eventually went with the drop-down list. I came up with these options by thinking about previous examples I’ve seen on other websites as well as trying to imagine myself as a user and thinking which feature would be the easiest to use.<br/><br/>




<h3>Tell me about a time when you had the lead role in managing a student project.</h3>
While I haven’t really had many substantial group projects here at school, I do have some experiences from high school. Each year in high school, I attended a semesterly programming competition held at the University of Pennsylvania with my school’s programming club. We had 5 hours to solve 6 problems, and we were in teams of 4. As an underclassman, I usually focused more on solving the problems that the group’s leader gave, as I was pretty inexperienced in comparison to others on my team. By my senior year, however, I felt comfortable enough with my skills that I could take on a leadership role. In addition to solving the problems, I delegated parts of problems to the others on the team, and made sure we were efficient in both how we solved the problems and how we managed our resources, as we were only allowed one computer per team. Overall, we finished 2nd out of 51 teams, and I was pretty happy with how everything ended up.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about a difficult decision you’ve had to make in the last year.</h3>
At the end of the summer, I went on a trip with a professor, Dr. Mark Wellman, to the west coast on a study tour to examine the cultures and values of different companies out west. Deciding to go on this trip, however, was not an easy decision at all. It was a fairly expensive trip, and as an out-of-state student, money was definitely an issue. However, the more I read about the trip, the more I wanted to go as a result of my own curiosity about these companies but also because of the fantastic connections this trip afforded. I am so incredibly satisfied with my decision; I learned more than I ever could have hoped to and made incredible connections with people at companies like Netflix, Intel, Tesla, and Nike. This decision was not an easy one to make, but I feel it was definitely worth it in the end.<br/><br/>


<h3>How have you worked to achieve your own professional vision?</h3>
As I’ve mentioned before, I have worked tirelessly since the start of high school to learn more and improve my programming skill set. In order to be a successful programmer, it is necessary to keep learning and constantly be improving. The field is rapidly shifting, and whether it be in the most popular languages or the most useful conventions, in order to be successful as as programmer, it’s necessary to really stay on of the ball, which requires a constant drive and thirst for knowledge.<br/><br/>


<h3>Please describe two situations for me – one in which you received very positive feedback on your performance and one where you received pretty negative feedback. What happened in each situation? What did you do? What was the outcome?</h3> 
From around 5th grade all the way up to my senior year of high school, I played tennis year round, both for the school’s team and with a different coach during the offseason. My coach during the offseason, Mike, was a very straightforward guy and never failed to tell it to you like it is. He praised good shots and great effort, but didn’t hold back when he could tell I wasn’t giving it my all. When I was having a particularly great day, he would make sure I knew it. I felt on top of the world, and his positive encouragement only made me play better and better. Days when Mike was happy were the best days to play, and I still fondly remember just how great it felt to know I was playing my best. This feeling definitely appears again here in school, whether it be with external motivators like good grades or internal motivators like being organized or just generally having a great day.<br/><br/>


On the other end of the spectrum, an angry Mike was definitely not someone to mess with. When he could tell I wasn’t playing well or wasn’t giving 100% effort, “negative feedback” is putting it lightly for sure. To be honest, there were definitely times that his reactions made me feel worse about myself or my game. Most of the time, however, his negative feedback only made me play harder and motivated me in a different kind of way, like I wanted to prove him wrong. Overall, I’m really glad he gave me the “tough love” routine. I feel it really encouraged me to show him the level of intensity that I can bring on the court and furthered my passion for the game.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about a time you made a big mistake.</h3>
Last year, I had a massive paper due for a class during my first semester as a freshman. It was called the Personal Creativity Reflection, or PCR, and was notorious for the time and effort it took, as well as being anywhere from 40-80 pages. The paper was announced at the beginning of the semester, so I kind of put it in the back of my mind thinking that I had months to get it done. Well, months turned into weeks, and weeks turned into days, and before I knew it I had 5 days to write about 60 of the 70 pages. At that point, I realized I had made a huge mistake. With 5 days to go, there was no point in wasting time getting angry at myself or blaming anyone else or thinking of reasons to justify why I procrastinated so terribly. So, for the next 5 days, this paper was my life. Every minute I wasn’t in class was spent working on this paper, and I eventually got it done with a few hours to spare thanks to a couple sleepless nights. I knew I had made a huge mistake, but could do nothing but accept it and deal with the consequences.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about a time when you managed stress really well despite difficult conditions.</h3>
This semester in school has been particularly stressful, much more so than anything I experienced last year. Between 2 computer science classes, 2 more lengthy reflection papers for a study tour I did over the summer and a class I’m taking this semester, and planning a weekend-long event for my fraternity with 130 attendees, there were a solid 3-4 weeks where I constantly felt like I was drowning in work, just barely able to keep my head above the water. I found what worked best for me was writing out all of my responsibilities and getting to see them in front of me. When my responsibilites made the transition from the abstract nagging thoughts to concrete line items that I could check off and complete, my stress was much more manageable. This semester I have learned a lot about stress management and feel like I can effectively manage stress much more now than I could a few months ago.<br/><br/>


<h3>Describe a situation when you had to give feedback to a person for being demotivating to a person or team.</h3>
At the programming competition that I spoke about earlier, there was one particular team member who was pretty demotivating overall. He was a younger student, only a sophomore, and was pretty upset that he couldn’t solve any of the problems on his own. Him being so demoralized was more detrimental to our team than his actual perceived lack of skills — in reality, he was a really smart kid. I took him aside and mentioned to him that he really <i>was</i> good enough to do some of these problems. I knew that he was because I had been in his shoes before, having the exact same feelings at the exact same competition. I told him that if he made himself think he wasn’t good enough, then he wouldn’t be good enough and that it was all in his head. For the rest of the day, he was more eager to contribute and ended up helping us out a lot.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about a time when you had to have a difficult conversation with someone.</h3>
Throughout my entire life, family has been the most important thing to me. Because of this, I highly value the approval and satisfaction of my family before making any difficult decisions, especially regarding college or my work life. For the past few years, my mom has made it very clear that she wants me to stay close to home and live at home for as long as I can, mainly because it’s difficult for her to let me, her oldest son, finally move out. I had to have a difficult conversation with her regarding an offer for a summer internship that would require me to live in College Park for the entire summer. It was a fantastic offer and a great experience, and I was really excited to accept. Before accepting the offer, however, I wanted to discuss it with my mom. I’m really happy with how the conversation ended up going. To date, I would say this was one of the most difficult conversations I’ve had to have with someone.<br/><br/>


<h3>Tell me about one of the toughest groups you’ve had to work with. What made it difficult? What did you do?</h3>
For most of middle and high school, I worked as a tennis instructor for my coach, Mike. I mainly taught young kids who were either in elementary or middle school, and the other instructors were around the same age as I was (late middle school - early high school). Motivation was often a big problem at the tennis camp, both with the kids as well as the other instructors. This past summer, I took on the lead role at the camp and acted as the manager whenever Mike wasn’t around. The group of instructors we had this past summer was by far the most difficult group I had to work with. They were constantly unmotivated, which detracted from the kids’ experience as well. To make things more difficult, the instructors were my friends, and it was difficult for me to really reprimand them when I was so close to them outside of the job. I knew as the head tennis pro there, it was up to me to keep these guys in line and made sure they were taking things seriously. It took a lot of work to say the least, and I had to pretty much stay on them for the entirety of the camp, but I made sure that they were working hard enough to make sure the kids were having a good time. This was, by far, the most difficult group I had to work with.<br/><br/>
