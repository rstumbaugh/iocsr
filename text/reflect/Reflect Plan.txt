<h2>Previous Goals</h2><br>
The following are the goals I outlined for the semester back in September regarding my REFLECT results.<br>
<br>
<blockquote class=”blockquote”><br>
After taking the REFLECT assignment last year, I was disappointed with my scores to say the least. I only scored above a 50% in one category, resilience, and was almost completely on the left end of the spectrum with innovation and decision-making. The 3 skills I plan on improving over the next few months are Decision Making, Innovation, and Strategic Vision. Strategic Vision is the skill I have noticed I am lacking the most. When I am working on any sort of task, project, or assignment, I often find myself getting lost in tiny details or getting distracted by small problems that are at times insignificant in terms of the bigger picture. Specifically, I notice this at work. At my new job, I am programming in a language I am not very familiar with and a framework I have never used before. This results in a lot of Googling, and I end up getting caught up in small details or problems. When I walk away from the problem and come back to it with a fresh mind, I notice how much I have strayed from the task at hand. I plan on improving this specifically at work. In terms of decision-making and innovation, I feel the only way to get better at these things is simply to do them more. I do not like being faced with tough decisions and often spend too much time analyzing challenges before taking action. Often times, inaction is worse than a bad decision. In addition, I am much more comfortable taking the beaten path rather than coming up with a new solution for the problem and pushing myself. These 3 skills are the skills I feel I need to improve the most, and I am going to force myself to change my habits and become more mindful of what I’m doing over the next few months. <br>

<h2>Evaluating Success</h2><br>
I have noticed the biggest change in my Strategic Vision abilities. Since creating this plan, I have been much more mindful of taking a step back and viewing problems holistically rather than getting caught up in the tiny details. Making this plan was eye opening in terms of looking at myself and my skills and evaluating what needs work and how I can improve. Now, I notice that I tend not to lose sight of the bigger picture when attacking a problem in most situations. While this skill is not 100% perfect, I certainly feel it has improved. With regard to the other skills, Decision Making and Innovation, I feel like I still need much more work and there is a lot of room for improvement. While I have still made some progress, especially in my Decision Making, there is definitely a lot of work to be done.<br>
