<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The Everest simulation was both an entertaining and useful assessment as well as a fantastic learning experience. My group consisted of Pablo Rubio, Katie Farlese, Parshya Kavoosi, Grace Zhang, and myself, the Physician. On our first run through, we did not get any of the challenges, and ended up with an overall team score of 54%. Our second run did not go much better — we made a fatal error that resulted in myself having to be rescued and took away the opportunity for many of our points, leaving us with a 35%. The third and final run through, however, went much better, and we got 2 out of 3 challenges and overall scored a 72% team score. <br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Going into the Everest assessment, we had discussed the importance of sharing asynchronous information with the rest of the group and making sure all the dots were connected. While performing the actual assessment, however, we quickly realized how much easier it was said than done. There is so much information that each person has available to them, and at times we all assumed that everyone had the same information visible. On our first run through, we particularly lacked in communicating the specifics about oxygen consumption and weather information. We all had a bunch of seemingly random information that only made sense when we collaborated and let each other know what we all had available. It is much more difficult to sift the relevant information from the irrelevant information than it appears! <br>
<br>
On our second run through, we understood a bit better the importance of telling each other all of the relevant information, and got better at determining what should and shouldn’t be shared. Nevertheless, I had to get rescued at the last camp before the summit, resulting in a huge loss of points for the team. Our third run through went much better, as we were pretty familiar with what to do and what was coming up. The first run through was certainly much more hectic, as we were faced with a huge amount of information and had to determine what was and wasn’t relevant. <br>
<br>
The main takeaway I got from this simulation was that effective teamwork requires deliberation and a strong leader. The leader of our group was seeking group collaboration rather than having a strong and directed approach to climbing, which was understandable as he was as new to this as we were. Nevertheless, a more directed approach to leadership definitely would have resulted in more success, and we should have more effectively weighed the opportunity costs of each of our decisions. <br>
<br>
The Everest simulation is definitely more than meets the eye, and there is a lot that goes into being successful. It requires deliberation, cooperation, and effective decision-making skills. It was a great assessment and I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to put my teamwork skills to the test in an entertaining simulation.<br>
