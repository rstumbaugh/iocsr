<h2>Previous Goals</h2><br>
The following is what I wrote back in September regarding my goals for how I wanted to implement the rules and principles in the book <i>How to Win Friends & Influence People</i>.<br>

Over the next few months, I plan on changing some aspects of my attitude and habits in order to become more successful both in school as well as outside of school. Up until now, I have never been very mindful of how I am perceived by others. Dale Carnegie outlines a number of principles that allow people to become successful if utilized correctly. The biggest areas I feel the need to work on are those of leadership (thinking like a leader, acting like a leader, and being perceived as a leader) and stress management. This semester is an especially stressful one as I am balancing a full schedule, an internship search, and an on-campus job as a web developer. In particular, I find the 4 Good Working Habits to be helpful: a) Clear your desk of all papers except those relating to the problem at hand b) Do things in the order of their importance c) When you face a problem, solve it then and there if you have the facts necessary to make a decision and d) Learn to organize, deputize, and supervise. I’ve never really realized it, but when I subconsciously do these things I feel more organized and less worried than I did before. Focus and decisiveness are important tools for battling stress and worry.<br>
<br>
In addition, I plan on improving my leadership skills. Personally, I find all of the skills under “Become a Friendlier Person”, “Win People to Your Way of Thinking”, and “Be a Leader” applicable in terms of becoming a leader. Being honest, yet sincere is a great way to not only gain the respect of others but to hold myself accountable to my opinions and actions. Being a leader is part acting like a leader and part being perceived as a leader. These are certainly skills I plan to work on over the course of this class.<br>

<h2>Evaluating Success</h2><br>
Looking back at the goals I had set out for myself, I would say I followed through with a majority of them. When I originally wrote this, I was incredibly stressed out and was dealing with it very poorly. By following the 4 Good Working Habits, I have been able to effectively manage my stress and juggle the various responsibilities I have had to deal with, from applying to internships to managing schoolwork to planning a trip for my fraternity. The 4 Good Working Habits have made it much easier to manage these responsibilities and achieve success.<br>
<br>
With regards to improving my leadership skills, I feel like I have made progress, but definitely still need some work. I have made an effort to be honest yet sincere and open to the ideas of others. I have been striving to be perceived as a leader and a generally composed individual and will certainly continue to follow these principles in the future to improve myself. I am a huge advocate of self-improvement and feel like I have benefitted greatly by following just a few of these principles taught by Dale Carnegie.<br>
