<h1>TED Talks</h1>

<h3>Lead like the great conductors</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Itay Talgam   <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Itay opened with a metaphor comparing his podium as a conductor with an office cubicle in order to get his audience to relate to him immediately. He then mentioned how, as a conductor, all it takes to get beautiful music and order from an orchestra is a small gesture. The opening was effective as it grips the audience immediately by painting a vivid picture in their head and being able to picture a conductor from the start.    <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>The talk consisted of many different examples of conductors and their styles. Some were commanding, others easygoing, one even had his eyes closed. Itay used this to make the point that at the end of the day, as a leader and conductor, you need to trust that the people are going to know what to do, and different styles can accomplish this goal. Talgam points out aspects of motivation, authority, relationship-building, and other leadership skills that one can learn from observing conductors. <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>The very end of his talk consisted of a few parting words, but mainly one last video of a conductor. This conductor stood there with his arms folded and barely made any movements, save for a couple of facial expressions and head nods. This video effectively conveyed the message that it doesn't necessarily take strong authoritarianism to lead a team. <br/>


<h3>Your body language shapes who you are</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Amy Cuddy    <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Cuddy starts with telling the audience that she has a life-hack that can substantially change their life, and first asks them to examine their own posture and body language. She begins to make her point that "we are fascinated with body language" by showing a video of a funny awkward missed handshake. The opening effectively both got the audience engaged and introduced her point and its relevance.    <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>The presenter makes the points that body language can affect your physiology at a chemical level and can affect your levels of stress and feelings of power. She presents scientific studies and claims from top experts in the social sciences in order to back up her points about power, risk taking, and confidence. She also made a very strong and powerful point about "fake it until you make it" versus "fake it until you become it".   <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>Amy closed with a strong yet strong call-to-action: "tiny tweaks can lead to big changes." She calls upon the audience to try power posing before their next stressful interview, presentation, or any other event, and also tells them to share this information with others. The closing effectively communicated to the audience that if they don't believe her, they can try it out themselves. Through the presentation and especially the closing, it is evident that Amy Cuddy truly cares about other people and their success.  


<h3>How to speak so that people want to listen</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Julian Treasure   <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Treasure starts with the importance of the human voice and touches on why or why not people may listen to them. The introduction was short, but effective, as it not only comments on the relevance of his presentation but gets the audience to agree with him if they sometimes feel as if people don't listen to them.    <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Treasure starts with detailing the "Seven Deadly Sins of Communication" and goes on to detail his acronym, HAIL, which represents the ways to combat these Seven Deadly Sins. As he goes into his points on the importance of voice and 6 different aspects of a pleasurable / effective voice, he uses all of these skills and varies them to show their true effectiveness and get the audience to realize just how different aspects of the voice such as timbre, pitch, pace, volume, etc. can affect their perception of what is being said.    <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>Rather than closing with a call to action, Treasure closes with an idea for the audience to think about: what if everyone were experts at speaking, and everyone was also always actively listening, and all environments had perfect acoustics designed for communicating? How would the world be different? Personally, I feel that a call to action along the lines of "use these vocal techniques" or something similar would have been more effective. The title of his talk makes his presentation seem more didactic than the closing did, and I feel it could have been more effective.  


<h3>How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Will Stephen    <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Will begins his talk by directly telling the audience he has absolutely nothing to say. While at first this sounds like a joke, as he continues it becomes evident that he genuinely has nothing important to say. The introduction is effective as it sets the tone of the presentation and gets the audience to really think about why his talk is so gripping.    <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>If looking at the actual content of what Will was presenting, there are absolutely 0 main points. At one point, he was actually speaking gibberish. His real main point, however, was that he was able to maintain our attention without actually making any points. He proves that in order to sound smart and be a gripping speaker, mannerisms, pace, vocal inflection, and nonverbals are much more important than what you actually have to say.    <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>The closing is as close as Will comes to an actual point throughout his entire presentation. He tells his audience to think back to what he had in the beginning, which was nothing, and to think about what he has now, which is still nothing. However, the audience was still intrigued throughout the entire presentation. Although he had no actual content, this is one of my favorite TED Talks as it demonstrates some key aspects of a successful presentation.  


<h3>10 ways to have a better conversation</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Celeste Headlee  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Celeste starts off with asking the audience if they have unfriended someone on Facebook or avoid someone because they don't want to talk with them or disagree with some of their key views. She then goes on to say that almost every conversation has the potential to be controversial, and we tend to avoid these controversial conversations. This introduction points out the relevance of her point and why the audience should listen to her advice.   <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Celeste's main point is that it isn't difficult to have a meaningful conversation. The main idea is to actually listen and assume that you have something to learn from someone else. Don't focus on looking like you are listening and paying attention and <i>actually pay attention</i>. It is obvious whether or not someone is paying attention, and actually listening to someone can also lead to a more meaningful conversation. Her main point is that in order to have a good conversation, you need to actually care about other people.  <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>Celeste closes with an anecdote about her childhood that led her to think that everyone has some amazing experience or profession, and that is why she keeps her mouth shut so often today. She always expects to be amazed and is rarely disappointed, and she urges the audience to do the same. She effectively gets her point across that everyone is an expert in something, and the call to action gives a way for the audience to utilize this information.


<h3>The puzzle of motivation</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Dan Pink  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Dan opened with a personal anecdote about how he attended law school and graduated in the bottom 10% of his class. He then went on to say how he had never practiced law in his life since he graduated, but today he was going to present a "lawyerly case" about why businesses should reevaluate how they motivate and incentivize their employees. His original anecdote about practically failing out of law school makes him seem more approachable as a presenter; many have not even attempted law school, much less graduated. Admitting his faults and failures makes him seem more human and relatable.  <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>The main points of this presentation are that the conventional ways of motivation are counterintuitive to the way the human mind works. Throughout the majority of his presentation, the screen behind him reads "There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does." Pink asserts that "carrots and sticks" types of incentives work well for mechanical, obvious types of work but are ineffective for more creative and complex problems. Pink presents scientific facts and research that support his claims and truly presents his points in a "lawyerly" fashion. Pink preaches the importance of autonomy, mastery, and purpose rather than carrots and sticks in terms of motivation.   <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>In Pink's closing, he clearly outlined his overall main point: there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. He then covers his sub-points about "if-then" rewards and extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation. His final note is that if businesses can learn to adapt to the scientific facts, we can solve more problems and be more productive as a society. This closing is effective as he leaves nothing ambiguous to the audience. He reiterates his main points and their importance, and ends with a lawyerly "I rest my case."


<h3>Why good leaders make you feel safe</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Simon Sinek  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Simon opens with a brief anecdote of a captain who recently won a Congressional Medal of Honor for saving men who were under fire and getting them to a medivac. The entire scene was captured on a GoPro video camera, and the captain was seen giving a kiss to the first injured man right before he turned around to go save more lives. Sinek then poses the questions, "Where do I find people like that? Why don't the people I work with act like this?" The powerful opening really draws the audience in while also effectively introducing his point: why do some people have this capacity for great love and affection?  <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Simon begins to make his points by starting in prehistoric times and examining how early humans survived against the constant barrage of danger through maintaining a circle of safety that is bound together by trust. He then compares this prehistoric philosophy to the present day dangers from which we need to be led to safety. Sinek discusses a friend that works at a New York tech company which has a policy to never fire employees based on performance. Sinek asserts that we are not unhappy with highly disproportionate salaries between executives and subordinates but rather we are unhappy with the fact that they will let all of their employees go in the blink of an eye. His main point was that a leader should be benevolent and make his subordinates feel safe.  <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>Sinek closes with a powerful story about an officer in the Marines who ate last so that his Marines could eat first. As a result, there was no food left for him to eat, so his Marines brought him some to eat. Afterwards, Sinek powerfully uses repetition as he explains why we call leaders leaders — because they make sacrifices for our safety. Simon Sinek masterfully used stories, pacing, and repetition to get his points across.


<h3>Why we do what we do</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Tony Robbins  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Opened with a very casual attitude right out of the gate and started talking about what he actually does. He makes it clear that rather than motivation, he gets to the root of why people do what they do. He has a short introduction and keeps it light, but it is effective at it introduces himself and his topic.  <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Tony talks about the "invisible forces" that guide our actions and shape our personality to this day ("We are our past"). The deciding factor in success and how we act isn't the resources but rather resourcefulness. He also talks about the 6 Human Needs: certainty, uncertainty, significance, connection, growth, contribution. Robbins asserts that these needs are the core needs that drive us and shape our lives one way or another. His final point is emotion and the effect that emotion has on our life and our model of the world.
<strong>Closing: </strong>Tony closes with a call to action for the audience to "explore their web." In addition to exploring their own personal web of needs and emotions that drive their actions, he implores them to explore the webs of others and to try and put themselves in the shoes of another person. Quite honestly, the closing felt rushed and brushed over and was not much of a conclusion to his speech, but the call to action did sum up everything that he discussed.


<h3>Let's face it: charisma matters</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>John Antonakis  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>John opens with a picture of himself at 17 years old, with a long Beatle haircut, and asks the audience what they think this 17 year old kid wanted to be when he grew up. The response was overwhelmingly "punk rock bass player." However, he really wanted to be an economist. This simple exercise already brings his point to relevance with the audience as it lets them see firsthand just how powerful looks and charisma can be.  <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Antonakis' first point was that just a person's face can say a lot about how people perceive their competence. He used discussed multiple cases of people correctly predicting election results by just basing it on faces and choosing the candidate who looks more competent, and even performed this experiment with the audience. Antonakis then asserts that the main way to overcome the importance of "the price on our tag" is with <strong>charisma</strong>. Antonakis discusses the 3 main aspects of charisma: frame, substance, and delivery.   <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>As a conclusion, Antonakis urges the audience to re-watch is presentation and identify the concepts and techniques that he used to make himself appear more charismatic. He then calls upon them to utilize these skills themselves to increase the price "on their tag", which is a callback to earlier in the presentation. This closing was effective as it not only effectively wraps up his presentation but also improves its relevance. Whether or not the audience actually goes and re-watches his presentation doesn't matter; Antonakis has already built his ethos up enough to influence these people. 


<h3>How to introduce yourself</h3>
<strong>Presenter: </strong>Kevin Bahler  <br/>
<strong>Opening: </strong>Kevin begins his presentation by introducing himself and stating his name and occupation. He then recalls how he used to introduce himself when he was much younger, and he would say whatever was on his mind: "Hi, I'm Kevin, and I like finger painting!" While the introduction definitely set the stage for his topic, his lack of vocal variety and expressionless face didn't get much of a reaction from the audience, and it was evident he was looking for laughs.  <br/>
<strong>Main Points: </strong>Kevin talks about the transformation of his introductions from elementary school to college, in which he would just introduce himself in a boring, normal, and safe way. Kevin made some powerful points about breaking out of your comfort zone and making friends who aren't "safe". He discusses the importance of passion and wearing your passions on your sleeve. While he maintains good pacing, his delivery still made me a bit uncomfortable and he got little to no audible reaction from the audience, which made the presentation a bit more awkward.  <br/>
<strong>Closing: </strong>The closing to his presentation is a call to action, challenging the audience to really think about how they would want to introduce himself based on their core values and beliefs. He finished with his own introduction: "Hi, I'm Kevin Bahler, and I love it when people are truly happy." Overall, I don't think that this closing was very effective in wrapping up his points, and the presentation overall was kind of awkward and uncomfortable.
