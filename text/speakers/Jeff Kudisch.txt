<h2>Summary</h2><br>
As a part of one of our Thursday sessions, we got a chance to hear from Dr. Jeff Kudisch from the Robert H. Smith School Office of Career Services. The main purpose of his talk was to help us prepare for the professional world and get ready for interviews. He started off the talk by discussing who OCS is and clearing up some misconceptions about the hiring process — mainly that students feel they are more ready for the professional world than recruiters do. The first part of the presentation then revolved around discussing what skills employers were actually looking for. Surprisingly, technical skills ranked fairly low on the list at #10. Leadership, communication, and drive were far more important. We then watched a few videos of interviews as examples of what not to do in an interview. The main point was that inner confidence doesn’t matter. Recruiters and interviewers can only make judgments based off of what they see, so you need to exude confidence. <br>

For the rest of the presentation, Dr. Kudisch discussed ways to prepare for interviews, including researching the companies and interviewers and putting some effort into your appearance as well. We also talked about the different types of behavioral interviews and went over some good and bad responses. The presentation ended with a discussion about the various resources the school has available to enable a successful interview experience.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
When I got the chance to hear Dr. Kudisch speak, I was in the middle of applying for summer internships and preparing for interviews, so the talk was incredibly relevant and helpful. One particular piece of info I was surprised to learn was just how little technical skills really matter to recruiters and managers in comparison to soft skills. The reasoning behind this, according to Dr. Kudisch, was that skills and smarts are expected when they are hiring for a position. While this may not always be the case, it is much better to have a competent employee who excels in soft skills than to have an expert employee who can barely hold a conversation. The corporate environment is so much more than just hard skills; it demands collaboration, communication, and teamwork. Being an effective communicator is one of the most important aspects of interviewing. <br>
<br>
Looking back at some interviews that I had already gone through, it was easy to point out some mistakes as I was hearing Dr. Kudisch’s advice. He pointed out how I should be talking for 80% of the time during an interview, but in reality I was spending maybe 50% of the time talking. <br>
<br>
In terms of interview prep strategies, I have utilized many of the strategies Dr. Kudisch provided us with. I recently had an interview for a summer internship, and made sure to research the company’s values and core beliefs before going in. In addition, I made sure to prepare a list of solid questions to ask my interviewer that demonstrated knowledge of the position and company as well as a desire to learn more. By following Dr. Kudisch’s advice, I was extended my first internship offer ever from the company, and now I already have an internship lined up for the summer! This talk was an invaluable experience and I am fortunate we had the chance to hear from a professional like Dr. Kudisch.<br>
