<h2>Summary</h2><br>
Dan Parsons gave us a presentation about the principles behind the Dale Carnegie Program and gave us some tips and strategies for public speaking. Many of his points had to do with nonverbal communication. Whether it be the pitch of your voice or the movements of your body, your nonverbals say a lot more than your actual content. In fact, Dan proposed that the words coming from our mouths only account for 7% of what the audience actually notices. The rest is taken up by our look, our act, and our tone of voice. It is for this reason, Dan mentioned, that messages are sometimes lost in translation. He called these mismatches between what we say and what we do “incongruences”, and these are huge factor behind why our message is lost.<br>

The majority of his presentation touched on similar points that we have covered in class, like having a direct message (Dan called it your “nail” that you need to hammer into the audience), repetition, nonverbal communication, and motivation. Nevertheless, this was still a very beneficial presentation looking back and I can say I learned a lot from hearing Mr. Parsons’ presentation.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Looking back on the presentation, there are some really valuable lessons that Dan Parsons taught us that night. I really regret being a bit “checked out” during the presentation, as I feel like I did not appreciate the knowledge I was being told at the time. In retrospect, however, we learned a lot of important concepts in this presentation. The one that has stuck with me the most is the idea there is a “small professional governor” in all of our heads stopping us from doing some really crazy stuff. We think that we look a lot sillier than we really do thanks to this little governor, so at times, we would be better suited to emphasize our body language and movements a bit more, because humans aren’t too great at judging what they look like. When I gave my TED Talk, I was thinking of the little governor in my head stopping me from making  big, extreme movements, and tried to put a little more emphasis on my body language. <br>

Another key idea I took away from this evening was the Triangle of Success for giving a presentation. The base of the triangle is represented by your knowledge. The knowledge is necessary for a presentation and is kind of the “minimum requirement.” It’s the application of your knowledge, Dan said, that really makes the difference. The left side of the triangle represents skill. Skill differs from knowledge in that skill is the effective practice and application of your knowledge. Finally, the right side represents your attitude, which is the most important part of a presentation. Attitude encompasses everything from confidence to resilience to ownership. While preparing for my TED Talk and watching other TED Talks, I thought a lot about that last part: ownership. I often think back to the example that Dan used: if you were giving a presentation and President Obama was in the room, you would still own the room. If you asked everyone to stand up, Obama would stand up. For the short amount of time that you are presenting, you are in control of the room. This is a really empowering sentiment and definitely a confidence booster for me while I was giving my presentation, knowing that for these 5 minutes I was in control.<br>
<br>
I found it interesting that many of the concepts Dan discussed were also concepts we discussed in class, proving just how applicable these skills are in the real world. Overall, I enjoyed the presentation from Dan Parsons. I wish I appreciated the lessons learned more at the time, but I’m glad I got a chance to think back on that evening and reflect on what I really learned. <br>
