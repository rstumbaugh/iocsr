Over the past semester, I have learned a great deal of information in this class related to public speaking and just general professional advice. Out of everything I have learned in this class, I can break down my key takeaways from the semester into 3 main points which I feel fully encapsulate both the breadth and depth of material covered in this course.<br>
<br>
<strong>Charisma is key</strong><br>
Whether it be in a presentation, job interview, or other professional environment, charisma is truly the key to success. People always tend to prefer a more charismatic person over a less charismatic person in terms of likability, and by simply following 3 tactics I can become a more likeable and charismatic person: animated voice, facial expressions, and gestures. When delivering a presentation, being charismatic will result in greater audience engagement. It is more interesting to watch someone who is moving around rather than standing still. It is more interesting to listen to someone who is in control of their voice. It is more interesting to observe someone who changes their facial expressions to match the tone of what they are saying. <br>
<br>
While other communication skills are integral in a successful professional life, I feel that charisma is really the building block upon which the rest of these skills must be constructed. It is much easier to get your message across to others when you come off as a charismatic and likeable person, and this class really helped me identify how to be charismatic and improve my skills.<br>
<br>
<strong>People are complex (and that’s okay)</strong><br>
Another key concept I have taken away from this class is the idea that people are <i>incredibly</i> complex. When trying to motivate a group of people, it becomes incredibly difficult to create a vision that your team will want to follow. When delivering a presentation, a joke or story that lands really well with one crowd may not go over as well with another audience. In an interview, just because the last hiring manager really took a liking to you does not mean that this recruiter will love you immediately. Because people are so complex, you are not going to be able to satisfy everyone 100% of the time. <br>
<br>
But that’s okay! The key to being an effective communicator, I’ve learned in this class, is being able to read your audience and adjust your presentation / pitch / story accordingly. Being a great communicator doesn’t mean having 1 way to give a presentation that worked really well once or twice. Being a great communicator means having the ability to get your message across effectively regardless of your audience. People are complex, and whether I am trying to motivate a team or immerse an audience in a story, I need to be able to switch up my message and make adjustments whenever necessary to really make sure I “hammer in the nail” (in the words of Dan Parsons).<br>
<br>
<strong>I am in control</strong><br>
The most important message I have taken away from this course is the fact that I am in control. I am in control of my presentation, my personal development, and my life. This class has shown me that skills like public speaking and charisma which I previously thought were inherent skills are actually learnable and can be taught. As a result, I feel more empowered than ever. The Dale Carnegie Program gave me the framework for self-improvement and becoming a better person, a better leader, a better professional, and now it is up to me to follow through with it. <br>
<br>
With my first internship coming up this summer, I am on the edge of entering the professional world. To be honest, I am completely terrified. I am terrified of leaving the safety of college before entering the real world. Nevertheless, knowing that I am in control of my future and my success is incredibly empowering. Going into this class, I knew that I was not the best at public speaking and figured I would have a tough time in this class in comparison to those who already knew how to present well. I figured that I really had no way to get better, as I had never really been a great communicator anyway. To be honest, I am still not the best. There are definitely areas of my communication skills that need improvement. However, this class has taught me that all hope is not lost. I now know that nobody decides just how much I can grow personally and professionally but <strong>me</strong>.<br>
