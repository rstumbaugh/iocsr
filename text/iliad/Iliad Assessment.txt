<h2>Summary</h2><br>
The Iliad assessment was run the same way as it was last year, so I was a bit more prepared and knew what was coming. My first meeting was not for around an hour after the start, so I had a lot of time to address my inbox items. After the first meeting, the presentation / other meeting was essentially back to back, so I didn’t have much remaining time to work on the rest of the inbox items. The presentations and meetings were similar to those of last year, and the inbox items were even the same as well, so I had a bit of an idea of what to look out for. Overall, I feel I did better this year than last year on the assessment.<br>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2><br>
Going into the Iliad assessment, I was a bit more prepared in terms of knowing what to expect and how to manage my time. Nevertheless, it was still a beneficial exercise that I feel all students should participate in. The inbox items were identical to those of last year, but I feel I handled them a bit differently than I previously did. I got around 7 or 8 done this year, which is around the same as last year, but I feel I was more methodical and organized in my approach. I knew what to look out for and had a better feel for how to handle the situations and problems that arose.<br>
<br>
The biggest change I noticed from last year to this year, however, was an increase in my confidence and self-assurance in group meetings and the presentation. Though I definitely feel as though I could have prepared more for the presentation, I wasn’t nearly as nervous giving my presentation as I was last year. Though it is still difficult to talk about content that you have little to no knowledge or exposure to, I feel as though it went well in comparison to my performance last year.<br>
<br>
In addition, I feel as though I was much more present in the meetings. Taking the assessment last year, I was very quiet during the meetings and did not make much of an impression. This year, on the other hand, I took charge during the meetings and made sure my voice was heard while still respecting the decision and opinions of my other group members. A big contributing factor to this was definitely having seen the information before, though I still feel like it was also a result of an increase in confidence from last year. I am curious to see my results and compare them to my results from last year. I expect to see a couple of higher scores, as I was fairly unsatisfied with my score from last year (though I do agree with the scores I received). I’m glad we got a chance to take the assessment again.<br>
